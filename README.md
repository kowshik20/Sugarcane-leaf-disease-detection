# Sugarcane-leaf-disease-detection
The goal is to create a solution that can accurately classify the type of disease affecting the sugarcane based on the visual characteristics of the leaves. By automating the disease detection process, this project seeks to provide a valuable tool for farmers and agronomists to better manage and address potential disease outbreaks in sugarcane plantations.
# Dataset:
Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/sugarcane-leaf-disease-dataset.
consists of 2521 images of sugarcane leaves belonging to five different categories: Healthy, Mosaic, Red Rot, Rust, and Yellow.
# Methodology:
This project evaluated multiple deep learning models, including EfficientNet, DenseNet201, MobileNet, InceptionV3, AlexNet, and VGG19, for sugarcane leaf disease detection. EfficientNet demonstrated the highest accuracy, which was further improved by applying self-attention. The results show a increase in accuracy and F1-score compared to the base EfficientNet model.
